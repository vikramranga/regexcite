**Note: This is a toy package I build while reading the book on it


# regexcite

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of regexcite is to make a toy package and play with it! 

## Installation

You can install the development version of regexcite from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("vikramranga/regexcite")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(regexcite)
x <- "alpha, bravo, charlie, delta"
str_split_one(x, pattern = ",")
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this.

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
